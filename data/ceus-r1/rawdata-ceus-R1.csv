We collect over 65,000 Twitter messages relating to Hurricane Irene from August 18th to August 31st, 2011, and group them by location and gender. We train a sentiment classifier to categorize messages based on level of concern, and then use this classifier to investigate demographic differences.We report three principal findings: (1) the number of Twitter messages related to Hurricane Irene in directly affected regions peaks around the time the hurricane hits that region; (2) the level of concern in the days leading up to the hurricane?s arrival is dependent on region; and (3) the level of concern is dependent on gender, with females being more likely to express concern than males. Qualitative linguistic variations further support these differences. We conclude that social media analysis provides a viable, real-time complement to traditional survey methods for understanding public perception towards an impending disaster.",,data-centric,data preparation,topic classification,natural disaster,hurricanes,2011 Irene hurricane,public agencies,Twitter,,yes,demographic data,exploratory,api,Inferring gender user (matching againsts Census most polular names) and location (state level manualy),,,,,,,no

Without knowledge of the locations of affected people, relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate method exists to track population movements after disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. Methods and Findings Geographic positions of SIM cards were determined by the location of the mobile phone tower through which each SIM card connects when calling. We followed daily positions of SIM cards 42 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude inactivated SIM cards, we included only the 1.9 million SIM cards that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there were 3.2 persons per included SIM card. We used this ratio to extrapolate from the number of moving SIM cards to the number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered 8 days and tracked 138,560 SIM cards. An estimated 630,000 persons (197,484 Digicel SIM cards), present in Port-au-Prince on the day of the earthquake, had left 19 days post-earthquake. Estimated net outflow of people (outflow minus inflow) corresponded to 20% of the Port-au-Prince pre-earthquake population. Geographic distribution of population movements from Port-au-Prince corresponded well with results from a large retrospective, population-based UN survey. To demonstrate feasibility of rapid estimates and to identify areas at potentially increased risk of outbreaks, we produced reports on SIM card movements from a cholera outbreak area at its immediate onset and within 12 hours of receiving data. Conclusions Results suggest that estimates of population movements during disasters and outbreaks can be delivered rapidly and with potentially high validity in areas with high mobile phone use.",,human-centric,human mobility,population flows,natural disaster,earthquakes,2012 Haiti earthquake,emergency managers,GPS data from mobile phone,user position,no,,exploratory,traces and stores geographic position for each mobile phone caller,,,,,,,basic mapping,no

Their content often includes references to events occurring at, or affecting specific locations. Within this article we analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of theÿtwitterÿfeed activity responding to a 5.8 magnitude earthquake which occurred on the East Coast of the United States (US) on August 23, 2011. We argue that these feeds represent a hybrid form of a sensor system that allows for the identification and localization of the impact area of the event. By contrasting this with comparable content collected through the dedicated crowdsourcing ?Did You Feel It?? (DYFI) website of the U.S. Geological Survey we assess the potential of the use of harvested social media content for event monitoring. The experiments support the notion that people act as sensors to give us comparable results in a timely manner, and can complement other sources of data to enhance our situational awareness and improve our understanding and response to such events.",,crisis-centric,crisis management (detection and prediction),variables estimation,natural disaster,earthquakes,2011 Mineral Earthquake,decision makers,Twitter,,yes,crowdsourcing ?Did You Feel It??

The online monitoring of short messages posted in such networks often provides insight on the repercussions of events of several different natures, such as (in the recent past) the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the royal wedding in Britain and the death of Osama bin Laden. Studying the origins and the propagation of messages regarding such topics helps social scientists in their quest for improving the current understanding of human relationships and interactions. However, the actual location associated to a tweet or to a Facebook message can be rather uncertain. Some tweets are posted with an automatically determined location (from an IP address), or with a user-informed location, both in text form, usually the name of a city. We observe that most Twitter users opt not to publish their location, and many do so in a cryptic way, mentioning non-existing places or providing less specific place names (such as ?Brazil?). In this article, we focus on the problem of enriching the location of tweets using alternative data, particularly the social relationships between Twitter users.

Location mentions are particularly important in disaster messages as they can show emergency responders where problems have occurred. This article explores the sorts of locations that occur in disaster-related social messages, how well off-the-shelf software identifies those locations, and what is needed to improve automated location identification, called geo-parsing. To do this, we have sampled Twitter messages from the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand. We annotated locations in messages manually to make a gold standard by which to measure locations identified by a Named Entity Recognition software. The Stanford NER software found some locations that were proper nouns, but did not identify locations that were not capitalized, local streets and buildings, or non-standard place abbreviations and mis-spellings that are plentiful in microtext.

In this paper we question whether such Web applications can serve as a reliable sources of spatial content. We make the differentiation between spatially explicit and implicit applications, in accordance to their declared aims and evaluate if this has an impact of the spatial distribution of geotagged photos for Great Britain. We also compare the spatial distribution of the photos submitted with population data, and the patterns of contribution to these sources over a period of 18 months. Finally, at a larger scale, we examine the spatial distribution of photos and their spatial density for 15 test areas and look into issues such as data currency and user behaviour.

This real-time crowdsourcing of crisis information provided direct support to key humanitarian resources on the ground, including Search and Rescue teams. In addition to its use as a knowledge base for rescue operations and aid provision, the spatial distribution of geolocated SMS messages may represent an early indicator on the spatial distribution and on the intensity of building damage. This work explores the relationship between the spatial patterns of SMS messages and building damage. The latter is derived from the detailed damage assessment of individual buildings interpreted in post-earthquake airborne photos. The interaction between SMS messages and building damage is studied by analyzing the spatial structure of the corresponding bivariate patterns. The analysis is performed through the implementation of cross Ripley's K-function which is suitable for characterizing the spatial structure of a bivariate pattern, and more precisely the spatial relationship between two types of point sets located in the same study area. The results show a strong attraction between the patterns exhibited by SMS messages and building damages. The interactions identified between the two patterns suggest that the geolocated SMS can be used as early indicators of the spatial distribution of building damage pattern. Accordingly, a statistical model has been developed to map the distribution of building damage from the geolocated SMS pattern.

In this article we present an approach that leverages the complementary nature of social multimedia content by utilizing heterogeneous sources of social media feeds to assess the impact area of a natural disaster. More specifically, we introduce a novel social multimedia triangulation process that uses both Twitter and Flickr content in an integrated two-step process: Twitter content is used to identify toponym references associated with a disaster; this information is then used to provide approximate orientation for the associated Flickr imagery, allowing us to delineate the impact area as the overlap of multiple view footprints. In this approach, we practically crowdsource approximate orientations from Twitter content and use this information to orient Flickr imagery accordingly and identify the impact area through viewshed analysis and viewpoint integration. This approach enables us to avoid computationally intensive image analysis tasks associated with traditional image orientation, while allowing us to triangulate numerous images by having them pointed towards the crowdsourced toponym location. The article presents our approach and demonstrates its performance using a real-world wildfire event as a representative application case study.",,application-centric,crisis management (monitoring),actionable information,natural disaster,wildfires,Waldo Canyon wildfire,NA,Twitter; Flickr,,,,methodological,,NLP,,,,,"Getis Ord *, viewshed analysis",basic mapping,yes

Volunteers translated messages (text, e-mail, and voice) submitted by victims of the earthquake, categorized each message into a primary ?emergency need? category and subcategory, and georeferenced each message on a dynamic web-based map. Initial inspection of the categorized data indicated discrepancies between the emergency need submitted by victims and the subsequent categorization of the emergency need. Analysis of the main categorical data illustrated that 50% of the messages were mis-categorized by the volunteers, failing to convey the main idea of the victim?s message. At the subcategory level, approximately 73% of the messages failed to convey the main idea of the messages. These numbers are higher than the estimate of 36% error in categorization produced in an independent review of the Haiti Ushahidi database. While the volunteer response to the Haitian earthquake represents a paradigm shift in emergency response and victim empowerment that has been repeated in numerous natural and man-made disasters around the world, this study suggests the need for more research on the quality of the categorization (i.e., attribute data) of volunteered emergency data.",,data-centric,data quality,accuracy,natural disaster,earthquakes,2010 Haiti earthquake,humanitarian agencies,SMS,Usahidi platform,no,,descriptive,,classification,,,comparison,,,none,no

Through it, homes are characterized by the damage they have received using five classes ranging from ?Unaffected? to ?Destroyed?. Rapid acquisition of damage assessment data may be achieved through crowdsourcing platforms where volunteers review images of affected structures. Further, these images can be geographically enriched through Spatial Video technology, whereby a car with a GPS-enabled camera captures a video recording of homes as workers on the ground drive through neighborhoods affected by the disaster. This technology has several key benefits over field surveys, including reduced cost, the creation of a digital record, and the ability to process the images quickly through crowdsourcing. However, the quality of such user-generated content must be examined to determine its usefulness. An online survey was conducted using imagery from a Spatial Video data collection to determine the potential of using these technologies as a crowdsourcing platform. The survey was distributed to DA experts at the American Red Cross spread across the U.S. as well as individuals connected with CrisisMappers, a mailing list for people interested in the intersection between crises and geospatial technology. Groups of inexperienced and experienced users produced statistically similar results, demonstrating that such content can be trusted and useful for damage assessment.

However, in existing literature the aspect of geographical visualization of automatically analysed events is hardly addressed. In this paper, we propose to introduce hierarchical levels of detail, a concept from Geographic Information Systems, for the visualization of user-generated data describing a local event.

p114,A rich Internet application for automated detection of road blockage in post-disaster scenarios,2013,International Symposium of the Digital Earth,conference,NA,http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012124,"This paper presents the development of a rich Internet application for automated detection of road blockage in post-disaster scenarios using volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap street centerlines and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The architecture of the application on the client-side and server-side was described. The major functionality of the application includes shapefile uploading, Web editing for spatial features, road blockage detection, and blockage points downloading. An example from the 2010 Haiti earthquake was included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the application. The results suggest that the prototype application can effectively detect (1) road blockage caused by earthquakes, and (2) some human errors caused by contributors of volunteered geographic information",,crisis-centric,crisis management (recovery and response),collective damage assessment,natural disaster,earthquakes,2012 Haiti earthquake,NA,Open Street Map,,yes,LIDAR point data,exploratory,,,,,,,geoprocessing service for road blockage detection,basic mapping,yes

The objective of this research is to propose such a VGI system based on the state-of-the-art Geospatial Semantic Web technologies. A prototype for disaster response in Connecticut was implemented.
